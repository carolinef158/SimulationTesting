3D modeling/simulation on Advantage Scope is pretty particular, but here are some steps to take

1) Simulate robot code, open AdvantageScope, then in AdvantageScope(AS), click file -> connect to robot simulation
2) In AS, open a 3D Field window
3) Still in AS, click Help -> Show User Assets (It'll automatically open your file explorer)
4) In the file explorer, find the folder for this code, and then find the folder that contains the models and config. (Here, it's titled "Robot_CrescendoBot".) Copy the folder and go back to the user assets(I like spam clicking the back arrow) and paste it. YOU DO NOT WANT TO USE CUSTOM ASSETS
5) Back in AS, in the 3D field window, there should be a config in the bottom right. Click on the robot selector, and "CrescendoBot" should be an option. Click on it. 
6) On the left side, find SmartDashboard, then VisionSystemSim-main, then Sim Field. Drag Robot into 2D Poses. (The robot model should show up)
7) On the left side, find MyPose. Drag it into 3D Poses. Click the dropdown and select Component (Robot). The pivot model should now move with the 2D mechanism

(Also, I didn't properly configure the pivot model, so it's a little wonky yet)
