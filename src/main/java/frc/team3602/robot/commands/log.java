//initialized repository. on the black laptop, I made a clone and got the drivetrain code happy
//in the first test run, the drivetrain worked, the intake forward and reverse worked. I think the shooters worked but i dont remember 
//...the arms went down immediately, otherwise didnt work. the pivot never moved.

/* 8/14 AT NIGHT */
//back in this codespace, i deleted the polarity chooser stuff and added the kmaxspeed double in robot container so the drivetrain would default to get xbox cont input
//...i think thats what i did in the black laptop
// 
//in the pivot subs, i added a run command to set as default command, and it makes the pivot run with just ffeffort. I started making a new command to run the pivot differently, using a run command
//next goal is to finish rewriting the pivot commands and reworking it in the rest of the places

/*also 8/14 at night, but later */

//i think the pivot is better now and i fixed the button bindings for the d pad controlling the arms
